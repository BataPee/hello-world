# hello-world
This is a test project.
Hi there.
I have done programming back in my uni days and have not actively participated in coding for the last 3 years. My coding skill is rusty and I will need to get back in the game of computer programming. That is the main reason I registered myself with GitHub so I can start coding and bring some of my programming ideas into reality. 
I know it will take a while to get into the game but I have made up my mind to take it head-on not matter how hard it is or how long it takes. Wish me luck!

Regards,
Perez. A
